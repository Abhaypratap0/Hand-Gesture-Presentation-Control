# Hand Gesture Presentation Control

This project aims to develop a system that allows users to control presentation slides using hand gestures captured by a webcam or depth sensor.

## Introduction

Traditional presentation controls, such as remote clickers, can be cumbersome to use. This project seeks to provide a more intuitive and interactive way to control presentations using hand gestures. By detecting and recognizing specific hand gestures, users can navigate through slides, highlight important points, and control other aspects of the presentation without the need for physical devices.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Detection:** Capture hand gestures using a webcam or depth sensor.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Recognize predefined gestures to perform actions like next slide, previous slide, start/stop presentation, etc.
- **Slide Navigation:** Navigate through presentation slides using hand gestures.
- **Highlighting:** Highlight or annotate specific parts of slides using gestures.
- **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive user interface for configuring gestures and controlling presentations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-presentation-control.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the webcam or depth sensor for gesture detection.
4. Run the presentation control script.

## Usage

1. Configure the system to recognize your hand gestures.
2. Start your presentation software (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides).
3. Use predefined gestures to control the presentation (e.g., swipe right for next slide, swipe left for previous slide).
4. Enjoy a more interactive presentation experience!
